Hi, I'm Michael. I conduct psychology research, program in R, and write music. I am passionate about the methodology, philosophy, and communication of science and aim to share that with you through this site.

If you would like to keep up to date with my work you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mccarthymg) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mccarthy-m-g), or subscribe to any of the RSS feeds on this site. If you are interested in hiring or collaborating with me I encourage you to read my [CV](/curriculum-vitae) and to [get in touch](#contact).
