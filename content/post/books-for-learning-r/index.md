## Essential Reading

### [Hands-On Programming with R by Garrett Grolemund](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

This book will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples. It was written for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You’ll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools. Throughout the book, you’ll use your newfound skills to solve practical data science problems.

### [R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)

This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.

### [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz)

This book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it helps you to understand why R works the way it does.

### [R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org)

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this book you’ll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn’t matter if your first version isn’t perfect as long as the next version is better.

## Data Science

### [YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel D. Phillips](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)

The purpose of this book is to help you learn R from the ground-up, and to introduce you to the basic analytical tools in R, from basic coding and analyses, to data wrangling, plotting, and statistical inference. While this book was originally written for pirates, anyone who wants to learn R can benefit from this book. While the techniques in this book apply to most data analysis problems, it is catered to solving analysis problems commonly faced in psychological research.

### [R for Psych by Glenn Williams](https://glennwilliams.me/r4psych/index.html)

In this book you will learn how to use R for data analysis and presentation. This book has a particular focus on using R for psychology (hence the name), but it should be applicable to most cases in the social sciences. The book primarily takes a tidyverse first approach to R, but still covers some of the base R functions and the basics of programming. Along the way, the book looks into how R encourages open and reproducible science, and how R can be useful for managing your research projects as a whole.

## Statistics

### [Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners by Danielle Navarro](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/)

Learning Statistics with R covers the contents of an introductory statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students, focusing on the use of the R statistical software. The book discusses how to get started in R as well as giving an introduction to data manipulation and writing scripts. From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing ﬁrst, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, t-tests, ANOVAs and regression. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book.

## R Markdown

### [papaja: Reproducible APA manuscripts with R Markdown by Frederik Aust and Marius Barth](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/)

This book is a manual for the R package papaja. In this book you will learn how to create APA manuscripts, class papers, etc., in RStudio using R Markdown. This book focuses on writing in R Markdown (i.e., text formatting, citations, equations, cross-referencing, and appendices), and reporting data in R Markdown (numerical values, figures, tables, results from statistical tests). By the end of the book you will be able to create a reproducible APA manuscript which you can submit to academic journals, or submit for class assignments.

## R Shiny

### [Mastering Shiny by Hadley Wickham](https://mastering-shiny.org)

This book complements Shiny’s online documentation and is intended to help app authors develop a deeper understanding of Shiny. After reading this book, you’ll be able to write apps that have more customized UI, more maintainable code, and better performance and scalability.

## Version Control

### [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)

In this book you will learn how to: (1) Install Git and get it working smoothly with GitHub, in the shell and in the RStudio IDE; (2) Develop a few key workflows that cover your most common tasks; (3) Integrate Git and GitHub into your daily work with R and R Markdown. The target reader is someone who uses R for data science. The use of Git/GitHub in data science has a slightly different vibe from that of pure software develoment, due to differences in the user’s context and objective. Happy Git aims to complement existing, general Git resources by highlighting the most rewarding usage patterns for data science.
